<h1>Alert from user</h1>

Have people notify/alert you via your lamp. It should have integration via Slack, Telegram, Webhook. It should be able to block intrusive persons.

<h1>Drink Alert</h1>

Having enough water is important but many times people forgot to drink especially when busy. 

<h1>Alarm</h1>

Instead of waking up to pesky alarm clock it turns on your light in room to hopefully wake up without beeping alarm. Especially waking up to alarm clock can make you feel groky all day.

<h1>Break Alert</h1>

Using technique like pomodoro together with this lamp. When lamp is certain color it is reminder that you should work and when it is another color it is a reminder that is time to take a break.
